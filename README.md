## Features

- **Generate presigned URLs** for uploading files to S3 without exposing your AWS credentials.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker** must be installed on your machine.  
   Visit [Dockerâ€™s official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for installation instructions.

2. **AWS credentials**:
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

   Either set them as environment variables **OR** be ready to enter them interactively when prompted.

### AWS Credentials Policy Requirements

The AWS credentials used by this tool must have permission to perform **`PutObject`** on the target S3 bucket and object key. For example, your IAM policy could look like this:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
docker run -it \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID> \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> \
